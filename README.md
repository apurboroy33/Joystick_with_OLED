- 0.96" I2C/SPI OLED Display (SSD1306, 128x64)
- LED + 220Œ© resistor (optional)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)

#### The circuit diagram provided here is according to the I2C SSD1306 OLED Display. For SPI SSD1306 OLED Display, check the connections in "Circuit Connections".

## üì¶ Library Dependencies

Install the following libraries via **Arduino Library Manager**:

- [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)
- [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

## üñ±Ô∏è Uploading the code

- After all the connections are made up, open the source code according to your connections (present in [src](src) folder) in **Arduino IDE**.
- Click **Compile** first (checks for any errors), then hit **Upload**.
- After a few seconds, your Arduino Uno will run the code and your project will work like a charm.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

Take the following precautions to ensure safe and reliable operation of your OLED + Joystick + LED setup with Arduino.

### Wiring & Power
- Double-check all connections before powering the Arduino.
- Ensure all components share a common **GND**.
- Use the correct voltage levels.
- Avoid reversed connections of **VCC** and **GND**.
- Use a **220Œ©‚Äì330Œ© resistor** in series with the LED.
- Do not exceed the current draw from Arduino‚Äôs **5V** pin.
- Power the Arduino using a **regulated 7‚Äì12V supply** (center-positive) if not using USB.

### OLED Display
- Mostly try to operate it in 3.3 V first. If not, then switch to higher voltages (5V) gradually.
- Use the correct **I2C address** (usually `0x3C`).
- Avoid displaying static images for long durations (prevents burn-in).
- Use `display.clearDisplay()` and `display.display()` properly to update screen content.
- Power off the display when not in use for extended periods.

### Joystick Module
- Do not press or move the joystick excessively hard ‚Äî it uses delicate potentiometers.
- Handle the switch gently and don‚Äôt force press it.
- Use `INPUT_PULLUP` for the switch pin to prevent erratic behavior.
- Handle analog values with range comparisons (not exact values due to noise).

### LED Output
- Always use a current-limiting resistor to prevent pin overload.
- Check the LED polarity before wiring **(long leg = +, short leg = ‚Äì)**.
- Avoid drawing more than **20mA** from a single pin.

### Debugging Tips
- Test OLED and joystick **individually first**, then combine. (For individual testing, check out [tests](tests) folder for more info.)
- Use **Serial Monitor** to check raw analog readings during development.
- Add delays (`delay(100‚Äì200ms)`) in the loop to avoid flickering and serial flooding.

### Safety
- Never touch the circuit with wet hands or metal tools while powered.
- Disconnect power when rewiring or adjusting the circuit.
- Place the project on a **non-conductive surface**.

### Build Best Practices
- Use **color-coded or labeled wires** to keep wiring clear.
- Secure components on a breadboard or perfboard for stability.
- Add `.gitkeep` files in folders to maintain project structure in GitHub.
